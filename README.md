# Sales-Performance-Analysis
Objective: Apply the full data analysis pipeline using a real-world sales dataset. They will analyze trends in sales performance across time, products, and regions. The final output should help a fictional company understand what drives its sales, which areas/products are underperforming, and how to improve.
This project is a complete end-to-end data analysis initiative focused on understanding the sales drivers for a hypothetical company. The process involved collecting data from Kaggle, performing comprehensive cleaning and analysis, and ultimately creating actionable insights to improve business strategy.

## Project Breakdown
1. Data Collection & Preparation:

Utilized Python (Pandas) for data cleaning, processing, and handling inconsistencies to ensure high data quality.

Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover key trends and patterns, identifying top-performing products and regions.

2. Data Analysis & Querying:

Employed SQL within SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to query the dataset and answer specific business questions.

3. Interactive Dashboard Creation:

Designed dynamic and interactive dashboards using Microsoft Power BI, Tableau, and Excel to visualize key metrics.

## Key Findings & Insights
Overall Performance: Analyzed KPIs including total sales ($2.3M) and total profit ($286k). Tracked a strong sales growth trend from 2015 to 2017 after a slight initial decline.

Product & Segment Performance: Identified the Technology segment as the most profitable, with phones leading sales.

Geographic Analysis: Discovered that California and New York are the top-performing states in terms of sales.

Top Products: Pinpointed the top 10 most profitable products to guide future marketing efforts.

## Business Recommendations
